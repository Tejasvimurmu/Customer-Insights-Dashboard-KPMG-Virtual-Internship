üìä KPMG Customer Insights Dashboard

Overview
--------

This project presents a comprehensive customer insights dashboard developed as part of the KPMG Virtual Internship. The data visualization was created using Power BI, based on the provided dataset (full_data.csv) by KPMG.

The dashboard delivers key business intelligence insights into customer demographics, transaction behavior, and regional performance to assist in strategic decision-making.

Objective
---------

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize:
- Customer age and gender distribution
- Top-selling product classes
- Online vs in-store purchasing patterns
- Total sales by region
- Customer segments based on wealth and location

Dataset Breakdown
-----------------

The original full_data.csv was split into the following logical datasets for clarity and visualization:
1. CustomerDemographic.csv
2. CustomerAddress.csv
3. CustomerTransactions.csv

These subsets were created based on field relevance:
- Demographics: Age, Gender, Wealth Segment, DOB
- Address: Region, State, Postcode
- Transactions: Transaction Date, Channel, Product Class, Brand
